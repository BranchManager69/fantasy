Cool problem. Let me throw you a few good leads + thoughts (because yes ‚Äî ‚Äújust grab a black-box‚Äù is tempting, but you‚Äôll get better results by mixing smart data + domain adjustments).

Here are projection / usage / snap-based data sources (and some DIY options) you can bolt into your Python app:

## üîç Projection / Data Providers You Can Use Directly

These are APIs or services that already compute projections or provide the building blocks (snap counts, usage, advanced stats) you can ingest and tweak.

| Provider                                       | What they offer / strengths                                                                                                                    | Cons / caveats / notes                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SportsDataIO ‚Äì Fantasy Feeds / Projections** | They provide a fantasy projections feed (weekly) plus all supporting data: stats, depth charts, etc. ([SportsDataIO][1])                       | It‚Äôs a commercial product; cost may scale. You‚Äôll want to inspect how ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù their projections are, and whether it fits your tilt. |
| **FantasyData**                                | Full NFL API including stats, snap counts, etc. ([FantasyData][2])                                                                             | Again, you‚Äôll pay for access. But solid base for building your own ‚Äúusage + matchup‚Äù projection tweaks.                                   |
| **Fantasy Football Data Pros (FFDP API)**      | A lighter-weight REST API. They currently accept HTTP GETs and are free (at least for now) for basic usage. ([fantasyfootballdatapros.com][3]) | Their projections are likely simpler; you might have to layer your own sophistication.                                                    |
| **SportMonks ‚Äì Fantasy Football API**          | They bring live stats + some predictive insights (for general "football", may be more global than just NFL) ([Sportmonks][4])                  | If you‚Äôre strictly NFL, check that their depth/usage models are sufficient.                                                               |
| **Yahoo Fantasy Sports API**                   | You can get fantasy data (rosters, stats, etc.) from their API. ([Yahoo Developer Network][5])                                                 | They don‚Äôt necessarily provide high-quality projections out of box. More useful for state + historical data.                              |

## üõ† Build-Your-Own + Hybrid Approach (Recommended for control + accuracy)

Because you said you ‚Äújust need structure / usage-based anchors,‚Äù you can take a hybrid path: ingest raw usage/snap data and build your own ‚Äúbaseline projection‚Äù that you then adjust for matchups, volatility, injuries, etc.

Here‚Äôs how to do that (and what data you‚Äôll need):

### Key Data You Want

* **Snap counts / snap share** (i.e. how many plays the player is involved in) ‚Äî you‚Äôre already thinking of this.
  FantasyData has snap count endpoints. ([FantasyData][6])
  Lineups.com publishes updated snap counts. ([Lineups][7])
  FantasyPros publishes snap count leaders. ([FantasyPros][8])
* **Target share / route participation** (for WR/TE)
* **Carry share / rushing usage** (for RBs)
* **Red zone opportunities / goal line usage**
* **Pace / offensive plays per game** (so that usage share turns into absolute opportunities)
* **Historical efficiency (yards per route, per carry, etc.)**
* **Game context / matchups / defense strength**

With those, you can build a regression or simpler ‚Äúexpected volume √ó efficiency‚Äù model.

### Basic Projection Formula (skeletal version)

```python
proj_stat = (snap_share * plays_per_game) * efficiency + bonus_zones
```

Where:

* `snap_share * plays_per_game` = *expected usage*
* `efficiency` = historical metric (e.g. yards per snap, or route success)
* `bonus_zones` = extra bump if you expect more red zone usage or target volume.

You can regress these components (snap share ‚Üí actual fantasy per game) to calibrate weights.

### Where to get the raw data + how to pipeline it

* Use an API like **FantasyData** or **SportsDataIO** to ingest their snap + stat endpoints.
* If some needed fields are missing, consider scraping or combining from multiple sources (e.g. snap counts from public sites like Lineups, FantasyPros, etc.)
* Store historical windows (last N games) to compute trends / momentum / regression to mean.
* Build a ‚Äúbaseline projection engine‚Äù that gives you a projected usage + output; then you can apply your matchup multiplier, injury multipliers, etc.

## ‚úÖ Recommendation & Next Steps

If I were you (in ‚Äúfull control dev mode‚Äù), I‚Äôd do this:

1. **Start with a paid data provider** that gives you snap counts, usage, historical stats (FantasyData or SportsDataIO).
2. **Build a lightweight projection engine** using usage √ó efficiency as base.
3. **Layer your matchup / volatility / ceiling floors** modifications over it.
4. Optionally, **compare / blend** with a ‚Äúblack-box projection source‚Äù (like what FFDP or some paid service offers) to smooth.
